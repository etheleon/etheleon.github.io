So lets kick it off with some self introduction.
Being a PhD Candidate here in NUS, Singapore in Computational Biology / Metagenomics, I have plenty of time to read up 
on the latest statistical methods as well as learn how to apply them.

The blog fulfills the role as a platform for showcasing my analyses, technical aspects of my development
and my recent forray in the startup scene here in Singapore.

Being the tech co-founder of a Insurtech company, [fundMylife](https://fundmylife.co), it has opened my eyes to the many
facets of doing a (tech) business.
Besides software development, there’s so much more including marketing growth hacking and bizDev.

Back to the blog, I’m guess I’ll first blog about my research analyses first before going into startups.

The coming posts will be on analyzing mouse gut microbiomes which I’ve been working on for the past weeks.
Furthermore, the post will be broken down into 2 smaller posts, code will of course be published together.

See ya folks!
