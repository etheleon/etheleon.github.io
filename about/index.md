Hello, My name is Wesley Goi. I am currently doing my PhD at the National Univeristy of Singapore with Singapore Center for Life Science Engineering (SCELSE).


My research interests are in the analysis of Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics data from environmental samples such as wastewater, and data integration using SQL and noSQL database.

In my free time I am the CTO (web developer and data scientist NLP data) cofounder of fundMyLife Private Limited (UEN 201700459H), a online Questions and Answer portal for financial literacy.

* A virtual archive for writing about my research and experiences in the startup sphere, sharpening my writing skills and place to put down my rants
* You’ll find code examples to running the various softwares which I’ve written.
